/* Provide support for both ANSI and non-ANSI environments.  */

/* Some ANSI environments are "broken" in the sense that __STDC__ cannot be
   relied upon to have it's intended meaning.  Therefore we must use our own
   concoction: _HAVE_STDC.  Always use _HAVE_STDC instead of __STDC__ in newlib
   sources!

   To get a strict ANSI C environment, define macro __STRICT_ANSI__.  This will
   "comment out" the non-ANSI parts of the ANSI header files (non-ANSI header
   files aren't affected).  */
