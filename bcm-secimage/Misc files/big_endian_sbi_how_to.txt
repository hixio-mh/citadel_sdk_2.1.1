1. Build big endian SBI in the directory fw/sbi/big_endian_sbi/
2. Copy fw/sbi/big_endian_sbi/big_endian_sbi.bin/SBI_SECURE_CODE as ./f_big.bin
3. Byte swap the words in f_bin.bin using ./big2little utility, e.g ./big2little f_bin.bin f.bin
4. sign the f.bin by running sign_sbi_* script
5. Load this SBI into boot source and run the bootloader as usual.
