# NOTE: 
#  1. each key takes 3 parameters: key file, RevisionInfo, CustomerID. The latter two are read in as hex
#  2. the first key's RevisionInfo and CustomerID (e.g. the 0 0 following rsa_eng_key.pem) are not used, 
#     they are just place holders, but the rest of keys these values are used, and be put into chain of trust file
#  3. The example passes for bootrom version = 1, otp (key and customer id) both not programmed
