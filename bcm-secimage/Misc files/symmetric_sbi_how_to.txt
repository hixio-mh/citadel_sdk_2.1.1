1. Generate SBI with entry point at 0x189860 for HMAC-SHA256 only authentication

2. For hMAC-SHA256 and AES256 authentication, generate SBI with entry point at 0x189870. This is because 16 byte AES IV will be stored at 0x189860.

3. Copy the above generated image as f.bin here

4. Run the signsbi_symmetric_hmac.sh script for case1 above and run signsbi_symmetric_hmac_aes.sh for case 2 above.

5. simple_sbi_chipit.bin is generated with entry point at 0x189860 (for case1).  The corresponding HMAC-SH256 signed SBI is final_symmetric_hmac_ChipIt.bin.

6. simple_sbi_symmetric_iv_chipit.bin is generated with entry point at 0x189870 (for case2). The corresponding HMAC-SHA256/AES256 SBI is final_symmetric_hmac_aes_ChipIt.bin

7. Make sure to load otp_kaes256_hmac.bin into OTP/corresponding RAM location(pOtp6t in bootstrap.c) when authenticating symmetric SBI. On real silicon OTP must be programmed with symmetric keys to authenticate symmetric SBIs. 

8. For more information, refer SBL/SBI design documents, and BCM5892 architecture document.
